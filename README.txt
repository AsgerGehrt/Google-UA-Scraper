1. change user_agent to apply for your computer (http://www.whoishostingthis.com/tools/user-agent/)

2. input urls in sourcelist.csv FIRST column!

Please note:
-spyonweb.com index is not complete. On average it returns 1/3 of the actual UA's. 
-More results can be obtained by experimenting with/without www notations on urls. 
-Future project would turn away from spyonweb.com and instead scrape the individual webpages.
